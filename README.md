# sk-learn linear regression model
This is the code for my final project in STAT 462. The main aim for this project was to analyze a dataset and perform <code>linear regression / polynomial regresion</code>. The results have varied based on the different datasets and variables I have chosen.
## Running the Model
Cuerrently if you clone the project, <code>main_four.py</code> is the script which contains the polynomial regresion. In the near future, the structure will be changed and more easy to comprehend.
